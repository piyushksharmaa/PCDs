Approach: 

I was not able to think of this question on my own during contest as i was thinking very differently
In this we have to approach it simply 
That is find the smallest unit(divide by 2 until we can't able to)
Now if smallest unit can divide n then it is possible otherwise not.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define int long long 
signed main(){
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
		int m,n;
		cin>>m>>n;
		if(n>m){
			cout<<"NO"<<endl;
		}
		else if(n==m){
			cout<<"YES"<<endl;
		}
		else{
			int smallest_unit=m;
			while(smallest_unit%2==0){
				smallest_unit/=2;
			}
			if(n%smallest_unit==0){
				cout<<"YES"<<endl;
			}
			else{
				cout<<"NO"<<endl;
			}
		}
	}
}
